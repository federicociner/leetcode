# LeetCode Interview Questions

A set of solutions to LeetCode and HackerRank questions that I solved in preparation for software engineering interviews at tech companies. All of these questions are available on [LeetCode](leetcode.com) or [HackerRank](hackerrank.com), and some of them require a subscription to LeetCode Premium.

## Overview

Having recently graduated from Georgia Tech's OMSCS program, I finished my last semester with an algorithms course, which provided the necessary theoretical background for me start practicing with LeetCode problems almost immediately upon starting my job search. Additionally, I reviewed the following resources concurrently with online practice:

- Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition
- Elements of Programming Interviews in Python

## Questions

I used Anki to track and review the questions that I completed throughout the process. These are organized by specific subcategories, where a set of questions in one subcategory can and should be solved by applying a common pattern or set of patterns.
