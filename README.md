# LeetCode Interview Questions

A set of solutions to LeetCode questions that I solved in preparation for software engineering interviews at tech companies in the USA and Europe. All of these questions are available on [leetcode.com](leetcode.com), and some of them require a subscription to LeetCode Premium.

## Overview

Having recently graduated from Georgia Tech's OMSCS program, I had taken a graduate-level algorithms course, which provided the necessary theoretical background for me start practicing with LeetCode problems almost immediately upon starting my job search. Additionally, I reviewed the following resources concurrently with LeetCode practice:

* Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition
* Elements of Programming Interviews in Python

## Questions

I used a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/346mxqyH/job-interviews) to keep track of the questions that I completed throughout the process. These are organized by specific subcategories, where a set of questions in one subcategory can and should be solved by applying a common pattern or set of patterns.
